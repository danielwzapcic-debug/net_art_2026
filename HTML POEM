	<h1>A Complaint from Ancient Mesopotamia</h1>

	<hr>

	<p>
		<strong>Tell Ea-nasir:</strong> Nanni sends the following message.
	</p>

	<p>
		When you came, you said to me as follows:
		<i>"I will give Gimil-Sin (when he comes) fine quality copper ingots."</i>
		You left then, but you did not do what you promised me.
	</p>

	<p>
		You put ingots which were not good before my messenger (Sit-Sin) and said:<br>
		"If you want to take them, take them; if you do not want to take them, go away!"
	</p>

	<p>
		What do you take me for, that you treat somebody like me with such contempt?
		I have sent as messengers gentlemen like ourselves to collect the bag with my money,
		but you have treated me with contempt by sending them back to me empty-handed
		several times &nbsp; through enemy territory.
	</p>

	<h2>Nanis Qaulms</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Low-quality copper ingots</li>
		<li>Broken promises</li>
		<li>Messengers treated disrespectfully</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Is there anyone among the merchants who trade with Telmun who has treated me in this way?
		You alone treat my messenger with contempt!
	</p>

	<h3> Financial Specifications</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>One mina of silver is disputed</li>
		<li>1,080 pounds of copper were given to the palace</li>
		<li>The agreement was recorded on a sealed tablet</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		How have you treated me for that copper?
		You have withheld my money bag from me in enemy territory.
		It is now up to you to restore my money to me in full.
	</p>

	<p>
		Take cognizance that from now on I will not accept here any copper from you
		that is not of <strong>fine quality</strong>.
		I shall select the ingots individually in my own yard,
		and I shall exercise my right of rejection because you have treated me with contempt.
	</p>
